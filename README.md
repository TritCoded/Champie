# ü§ñOverview

Champie is a discord bot I'm making for a personal server that utilizes data from Riot Games Data Dragon. Champie is currently a work in progress, but I'm having loads of fun developing them.

Champie, as well as the code for Champie, is currently not avaliable for public use. I'm hoping to release it later on when it's more developed and the code is cleaned up a bit. I'm learning as I'm doing things, so it's pretty hectic at the moment.

Discord allows bots to send custom emojis from any server the bot is in, similar to nitro users, so I made multiple servers with custom emojis for all 168(?) champs and other icons such as roles and ability buttons for aesthetic displays from Champie.

# ‚ùîCommands
### help
Help returns a list of Champie's commands, and a short description

### randomchamp
Randomchamp displays information about a random League of Legends champion, including their name, title, roles, resource, and abilities. The idea behind this was to get a random champion to play when you're about to pick and don't know who to play.

### champ
Champ is similar to randomchamp, except you can specify a champion to see the same information. I pick Aphelios here because he's cool.

### lore
Lore displays a champions lore, if you type ?lore random, it will return the lore of a random champion.

### clash
Clash is useful for creating clash teams. It notifies people that a user is looking for members and allows them to react with a role to show they are interested. It currently pings everyone but eventually I will make a custom clash role so it doesn't bother everyone.

Since I don't have full access to Riots API, this command has to be done manually. My hope is one day I can automate this command once the bot is more developed. 

# Plans for the future
Someday, I'd like to:
- Add champion tips to ?champ and ?randomchamp
- Automate clash commands
- Implement some party games
- _Maybe_ an economy/level system for users?
- Host Champie on a rpi for constant activity
